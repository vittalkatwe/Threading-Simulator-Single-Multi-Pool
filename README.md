## ðŸ“Š JMeter Benchmark â€” 1 Million Requests

We stress-tested the simulator with **1,000,000 requests** using **Apache JMeter (TCP Sampler)**.  
Below are the results for each threading model.

### ðŸ”Ž Insights
- **Single Threading** â†’ Surprisingly performed better than multi-threading. Although slower on average, its error rate (37%) was much lower.  
- **Multi Threading** â†’ Struggled badly (~75% error rate) because the server was creating a **new thread for every request**, which led to massive overhead and instability.  
- **Thread Pooling** â†’ Clear winner: **lowest error %, highest throughput, and lowest latency**. Reusing threads via a pool prevented the overhead seen in multi-threading.
